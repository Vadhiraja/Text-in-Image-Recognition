# Text-in-Image-Recognition
A python script built using Google Tesseract OCR to identify texts in an image

## How to Use?

-Install Python in your system

-Install the required libraries using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" after cloning or downloading the repository

-Install [Google Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) from the Official Git repository

## Working
-After all the requirements are installed, run the python file 'textinimage.py' 

-After running, a selection cursor appears, select the area of image that you want to recognise the text from.

-The detected text automatically copies to the clipboard and you can paste it in a work or a text file.
